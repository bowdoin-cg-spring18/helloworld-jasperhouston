# helloworld
Write a hello world program, compile it and run it from the terminal. GO through the git cycle.

compile program by typing 'make'

then run the program with './hello' to print "Hello World!"

alternatively, run the program with './hello x' where x is an integer > 0
to print "Hello World!" x times

A final option is to type 'cat helloWorld.txt' at the command prompt and
"Hello World!" will be printed (but this isn't actually running the program)
